				<p class='calm-voice'>Becoming a web developer started in a Best Buy. I was watching my friend open up the terminal on a Mac and I couldn't have been more confused as to what I was even looking at. So, I began to ask questions and from there my journey as a web developer began.</p>

				<p class="calm-voice">After a month of searching videos on youtube, going down tutorial purgatory, and talking with various coding bootcamps nothing felt right.</p>

				<p class="calm-voice">So, I came across <a href="https://perpetual.education/" target="_blank">Perpetual Education</a>in March 2021. Since being a student in the mentorship program I have and continue to sharpen my skills in responsive layouts, research and strategy, typography, visual design, user testing, and content hierarchy amongst other learned skills.</p>
