	<p class='info calm-voice'>This is me. This is how I started, why i started, when i started, and where i started. I continue on with your company based on these traits that I have and what I can accomplish. I am this, that, there, and now. I look forward to building "Me" by working as "We". I have found that through this, that, and then that I will do this. I am great at this and have dabbled in that. Also, check out my two cool dogs!</p>
